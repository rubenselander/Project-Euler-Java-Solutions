//Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, 
//and only being able to move to the right and down, 
//there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

//
//How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?




//At start
//steps to bottom = stb = rows = r
//steps to far right = str = cols = c

//a route consists of r steps down and c steps right. Here r = c = 20

//route consists of 20 steps down and 20 steps right.
//how many ways are there to order 20 d and 20 r
