//If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, 
//composed of fifteen blue discs and six red discs, 
//and two discs were taken at random, 
//it can be seen that the probability of taking two blue discs,
//P(BB) = (15/21)Ã—(14/20) = 1/2.
//
//The next such arrangement, 
//for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking two blue discs at random, 
//is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and thirty-five red discs.
//
//By finding the first arrangement to contain over 
//10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000 discs in total,
//determine the number of blue discs that the box would contain.
