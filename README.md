# Project Euler Solutions (1-100) in Java

This repository contains my solutions to the first 100 problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), implemented in Java. Project Euler is a collection of mathematical computing problems intended to be solved with computer programs. These solutions are provided to help others learn and to share different approaches to solving these challenging problems.

## Disclaimer

Please use these solutions responsibly. If you're working on Project Euler problems, I encourage you to try solving the problems on your own before looking at these solutions. The primary goal of Project Euler is to challenge yourself and learn new problem-solving techniques, and looking up the answers defeats this purpose.

## Prerequisites

To run these solutions, you will need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above
- Your favorite IDE or text editor capable of running Java programs (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code)

## Structure

Each solution is contained within its own Java file, named according to the problem number it solves (e.g., `Problem1.java`, `Problem2.java`, ..., `Problem100.java`). Each Java file contains a main method that runs the solution code and prints the answer to the console.

## Running Solutions

To run a solution, navigate to the directory containing the Java file for the problem you're interested in and compile and run the Java file using the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
javac ProblemX.java
java ProblemX
